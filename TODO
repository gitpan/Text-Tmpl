Stuff that may make it into future versions (patches welcome!)
 . Make subclassing affect the template objects created in perl_tags.c
 . Add a method for fetching a specific iteration (by number) of a named loop?
 . Improve the performance of loops with lots of iterations by keeping a
   pointer to the last iteration in the loop
 . Abstract the linked lists used in varlist, nclist, tagplist, staglist
 . Add a C++ wrapping layer
 . Add remove_simple and remove_pair functions, to support deleting tags?
 . Export default tags via XS, so that they can be assigned via register_*
   from Perl.
 . Port to win32?
 . Consistent, clean error reporting (something errno-like)
 . Make the parser more technically "correct" (i.e. single-pass, stack based
   parsing)
 . Turn the linked lists used for contexts, varlists and nclists into some
   type of structure that is more efficient for large numbers of members
 . Create ::Context, ::Varlist, and ::Nclist sub-packages
 . Make sure that all C structures are completely opaque
 . Make sure that all C functions have perl wrappers
