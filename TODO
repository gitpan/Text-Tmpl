Stuff that may make it into future versions (patches welcome!)
 . Port to win32?
 . Consistent, clean error reporting (something errno-like)
 . Make the parser more technically "correct" (i.e. single-pass, stack based
   parsing)
 . Turn the linked lists used for contexts, varlists and nclists into some
   type of structure that is more efficient for large numbers of members
 . Create ::Context, ::Varlist, and ::Nclist sub-packages
 . Make sure that all C structures are completely opaque
 . Make sure that all C functions have perl wrappers
