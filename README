Text::Tmpl is a module for very fast templating. There are dozens of
templating modules on CPAN, each only a tiny bit different from the
others. This one is no different - what sets it aside is speed. The
entire module is implemented as a C library, with only a thin XS/Perl
layer to make the calls available from Perl. The same templates, then,
can be used from either Perl or C/C++ programs.

This was originally designed to completely isolate HTML programmers
from module/CGI programmers, or at least completely separate logic
from content in dynamic web applications. It is syntactically based on
a similar system written by a friend of mine, Neil Mix, which was
proprietary and exclusively written in Perl. It shares no code in
common with this system, or any other.

Prerequisites

A C compiler, a unix (or derivative) machine, and Perl.

At this early stage, this module has only been tested on FreeBSD, Linux and
Solaris.  I'd be happy to test it on other systems, but I don't have access
to any.  It is known to not work under Win32, because of assumptions about
filesystem layout.

Building

  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make

Installing

  # make test
  # make install

Additional Information

There is a web page for Text::Tmpl at http://pootpoot.com/~dlowe/Text-Tmpl/
The latest version can always be found there.

You can my directly at dlowe@pootpoot.com.  I'm happy to answer any questions
you might have.

If there's enough demand, I will create a mailing list for discussion/support.
