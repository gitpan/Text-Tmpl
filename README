Description
===========

Text::Tmpl is a module for very fast templating. There are dozens of
templating modules on CPAN, each only a tiny bit different from the
others. This one is no different - what sets it aside is speed. The
entire module is implemented as a C library, with only a thin XS/Perl
layer to make the calls available from Perl. The same templates, then,
can be used from either Perl or C/C++ programs.

This was originally designed to completely isolate HTML programmers
from module/CGI programmers, or at least completely separate logic
from content in dynamic web applications. It is syntactically based on
a similar system written by a friend of mine, Neil Mix, which was
proprietary and exclusively written in Perl. It shares no code in
common with this system, or any other.


Prerequisites
=============

A C compiler, a unix (or derivative) machine, and Perl 5.

Text::Tmpl is known to not work under Win32, because of assumptions about
filesystem layout.


Building
========

  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make


Installing
==========

  # make test
  # make install

The C library version is not built or installed by default.  If you want to
use it, you can build install it by hand.  Something like this ought to work:

  # make libtmpl.a
  # cp libtmpl.a /usr/local/lib
  # cp *.h /usr/local/include

The 'libtmpl.a' target is only provided as a reference; it may very well
require modification for use on your system.  The same goes for the cp
commands listed above.


Additional Information
======================

There is a web page for Text::Tmpl at http://pootpoot.com/~dlowe/Text-Tmpl/
The latest version can always be found there.
